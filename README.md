This project consists of two parts: 
1. **Client (Frontend)** built with React.js and Vite.
2. **Backend (API)** built with Node.js.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following installed:
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (v14 or higher)
- npm (v6 or higher)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) (installed via npm)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) (optional, for version control)

## Client (Frontend)

### Setup and Installation

The client is built using React and Vite for a fast development experience.

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `client` directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Saurabh-s-Org/Mern-WorkShop
   cd Mern-WorkShop/client
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Run the development server:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. Open the app in your browser. By default, it will be running on:
   ```
   http://localhost:5173
   ```

## Backend (API)

### Setup and Installation

The backend is built with Node.js and Express.

1. Navigate to the `server` directory:
   ```bash
   cd Mern-WorkShop/server
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the backend server:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

4. The backend API will be running on:
   ```
   http://localhost:2000
   ```

## Running Both Client and Backend

You can run both the frontend and backend simultaneously in separate terminal windows.

1. In the first terminal, navigate to the `client` directory and start the Vite development server:
   ```bash
   cd client
   npm run dev
   ```

2. In the second terminal, navigate to the `server` directory and start the Node.js server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   npm start
   ```

Now, the client is accessible on `http://localhost:5173`, and the backend API is running on `http://localhost:2000`.
